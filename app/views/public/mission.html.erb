<h1>Our Mission</h1>

<p>As part of Hesburgh Libraries, we help to connect people to knowledge online. In the broad view, the WSE unit is responsible for the Librariesâ€™ web presence. We work in collaboration with other library units as well as other campus units to make scholarly information accessible online. </p>
